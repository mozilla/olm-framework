# Open Leadership Framework Contribution Guidlines

You do not need any special technical skills to contribute to this project. We will work with you to find a way to gather your feedback on this public alpha of the Open Leadership Framework. There are many ways to contribute regardless of your experience level with GitHub or working open.

## Getting Started with Open

If you are new to open leadership, working open or openness in general, the blog post ["How to Work Open"](https://openmatt.org/2011/04/06/how-to-work-open/) by Matt Thompson is an excellent primer.

## Ways to Contribute

You can contribute to this white paper in any way that makes sense to you.

***If you have a lot of experience with GitHub and working open,*** you might clone or fork the paper, send us pull requests to incorporate suggested edits, and/or even create a new version of the paper for your own use.

***If you have some experience with GitHub and working open,*** you might share your feedback with us using the Issue Tracker feature as explained below.

***If you have little experience with GitHub and working open,*** you might send your questions and feedback to [Chad](mailto:chad@mozillafoundation.org), the contact person for this project.

## Using GitHub to File Issues

GitHub can be challenging for new users. If you experience difficulty with it, you are not alone. We want to help you overcome those challenges or find a way to contribute that works for you.

For this project, we can use a feature called the "Issue Tracker" in GitHub to communicate with one another. It is kind of like a shared message board combined with a to-do list. To address an issue to a specific person, you add their name to the issue the same way you would to a tweet, like this for example: @chadsansing would address your message to Chad, the project lead.

If the Issue Tracker is too difficult to use, contact Chad. He will work with you and help you find a way to contribute no matter what.

Here are some steps you can take to get started on GitHub if you would like to try it.

1. First, create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com).

2. Then visit [our repo](https://github.com/mozilla/open-leadership-framework) to contribute to the white paper.

3. Next, click on the "Issues" tab near the top of the page.

4. Finally, click on the green "New Issue" button to the left of the page. You can then title your issue and add content. Specificity helps.

Before you submit your issue, label it. You can choose one from the "Labels" dropdown menu to the right of your issue.

We have labels that will let you suggest:

- *Case studies.* Help us curate stories that illustrate the best of Open Leadership and Working Open.
- *Challenges.* Let us know when we get something wrong and suggest a way to fix it.
- *Copy edits.* Help us find the mistakes and typos we have missed.
- *Questions.* Let us know what you wonder about as you review the white paper.
- *Other types of issues.* Feel free to share whatever is on your mind regarding the work.
